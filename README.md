# Unemployment Data Analysis

This project analyzes unemployment data in India using a Jupyter Notebook (`Unemployment.ipynb`). It includes data loading, cleaning, visualization, and basic statistical analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Dataset

The dataset used is `Unemployment in India.csv`, which contains unemployment-related metrics such as:
- Region
- Date
- Frequency
- Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)
- Estimated Employed
- Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)
- Area

Ensure the dataset file is placed in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path in the code accordingly.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/unemployment-analysis.git
     ```
     Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username if you have forked the repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd unemployment-analysis
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the required Python packages as mentioned in the Requirements section.

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Start Jupyter Notebook by running:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open the `Unemployment.ipynb` file in the Jupyter interface.

5. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load, clean, and analyze the data. Ensure the dataset file (`Unemployment in India.csv`) is accessible.

## Project Structure

- `Unemployment.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
- `Unemployment in India.csv`: The dataset file (not included in the repository; provide your own or update the path).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Notes

- The notebook includes code to handle missing values by replacing `NaN` with `0`, which may not be ideal for all analyses. Consider modifying the data cleaning approach based on your requirements.
- The visualization section uses Matplotlib to plot unemployment rates over time. Additional visualizations (e.g., by region or area) can be added.
- The `covid_period` column logic may need adjustment, as the current implementation uses a simplistic condition. Update it to reflect accurate pre- and post-COVID periods based on the `Date` column.
