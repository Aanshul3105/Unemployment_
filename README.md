Unemployment Data Analysis
This project analyzes unemployment data in India using a Jupyter Notebook (Unemployment.ipynb). It includes data loading, cleaning, visualization, and basic statistical analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python packages:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib



You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter

Dataset
The dataset used is Unemployment in India.csv, which contains unemployment-related metrics such as:

Region
Date
Frequency
Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)
Estimated Employed
Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)
Area

Ensure the dataset file is placed in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path in the code accordingly.

Project Structure

Unemployment.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
Unemployment in India.csv: The dataset file (not included in the repository; provide your own or update the path).
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

Notes

The notebook includes code to handle missing values by replacing NaN with 0, which may not be ideal for all analyses. Consider modifying the data cleaning approach based on your requirements.
The visualization section uses Matplotlib to plot unemployment rates over time. Additional visualizations (e.g., by region or area) can be added.
The covid_period column logic may need adjustment, as the current implementation uses a simplistic condition. Update it to reflect accurate pre- and post-COVID periods based on the Date column.
